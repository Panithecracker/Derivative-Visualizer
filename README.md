# Derivative-Visualizer
This project uncovers the beautiful geometric meaning of functions whose graph is 2D and 3D by using multivariable calculus and matlab programming and visualization tools.
## Introduction : The paradox of the derivative
Let s(t) be the function that describes the distance travelled by a red car after the pass of some time. There is another important function that can be in fact deduced from s(t) , which is the velocity v(t) at each instance of time. But, wait a moment, velocity implies in its nature different points in time, since it consists on the distance travelled after the pass of some time. How can then exist a value referring to velocity at exact instants of time? This subtle idea raises up a clear paradox whose solution approach is better seen with a real life example. How does the car velocimeter work it out to somehow inform you instanteneously the velocity of your car? Well, what it does is not really based on instantaneous information about the distance travelled but on leaving out some margin of time to pass in order to calculate the desired difference
